// Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.

// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

let alian_colour : string = "Green"
if (alian_colour === "Green") {
    console.log("Just earned 5 points for shooting the alien!!!"); 
}

// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

let alian_colour_two : string = "Green"
if (alian_colour_two === "Black") {
    console.log("Just earned 5 points for shooting the alien!!!"); 
}
else {
    console.log("The player just earned 10 points!!!");
